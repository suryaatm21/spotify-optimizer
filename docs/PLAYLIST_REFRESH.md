# Playlist Refresh Feature Milestone

## Overview

The playlist refresh feature ensures that cached playlists in the database always reflect the latest state from Spotify, including all tracksâ€”even when playlists grow beyond their original size.

## Key Milestones

### 1. Pagination for Large Playlists

- Implemented offset-based pagination for Spotify API calls.
- Now fetches all tracks for playlists with >100 tracks.

### 2. Smart Caching & Auto-Refresh

- System detects when cached tracks < Spotify-reported total and auto-refreshes.
- Manual refresh supported via API parameter or dedicated endpoint.

### 3. Dedicated Refresh Endpoint

- Added `/api/analytics/playlists/{playlist_id}/refresh` endpoint.
- Deletes old tracks and fetches fresh data from Spotify.
- Updates playlist metadata (total_tracks) after sync.

### 4. Frontend Integration

- API client updated to support refresh and sync actions.
- Usage example:
  ```typescript
  await playlistApi.refreshPlaylist(playlistId);
  await playlistApi.getPlaylistTracks(playlistId, true);
  ```

## Usage Scenarios

- **User adds tracks to a playlist on Spotify:**
  - System auto-refreshes if cached count is outdated.
  - Manual sync available for immediate update.
- **Playlists with hundreds/thousands of tracks:**
  - All tracks are now fetched and available for analysis.

## Technical Summary

- Pagination, caching, and refresh logic ensure complete and up-to-date playlist data for clustering and analysis.
- Feature milestone committed on August 1, 2025.
