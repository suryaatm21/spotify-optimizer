**Target**: Transform analysis insights into actionable playlist improvements

## üöÄ Priority 1: Listening Behavior Analytics

### Feature: Overskipped Track Detection
**Endpoint**: `GET /analyze/{playlist_id}/overskipped`
**Purpose**: Identify tracks that users consistently skip
**Implementation**:
- Track skip patterns from Spotify recently played API
- Calculate skip rate vs. average for similar tracks
- Identify tracks that disrupt playlist flow
- Suggest removal or repositioning

### Feature: Under-played Gem Discovery
**Endpoint**: `GET /analyze/{playlist_id}/hidden-gems`
**Purpose**: Find great tracks that don't get enough plays
**Implementation**:
- Compare play counts with track quality metrics
- Identify high-quality, low-play tracks
- Suggest promotion to better playlist positions
- Recommend featured placement

### Feature: Playlist Flow Optimization
**Endpoint**: `POST /optimize/{playlist_id}/flow`
**Purpose**: Reorder tracks for better listening experience
**Implementation**:
- Analyze energy transitions between tracks
- Optimize tempo and mood progressions
- Consider time-of-day listening patterns
- Generate optimal track ordering

## üöÄ Priority 2: The /optimize Endpoint

### Core Optimization Engine
**Endpoint**: `POST /optimize/{playlist_id}`
**Purpose**: Central optimization hub with actionable recommendations
**Features**:
- **Track Replacement**: Suggest better alternatives for poor performers
- **Reordering**: Optimal track sequence for flow
- **Additions**: Recommend new tracks to fill gaps
- **Removals**: Identify tracks that hurt playlist cohesion

### Optimization Algorithms
1. **Energy Flow Optimization**: Smooth energy transitions
2. **Diversity Balance**: Optimal variety vs. coherence
3. **Temporal Optimization**: Time-aware recommendations
4. **Mood Progression**: Emotional journey optimization

## üöÄ Priority 3: Advanced Analytics

### Feature: Seasonal Playlist Analysis
**Purpose**: Understand how playlist usage changes over time
**Implementation**:
- Analyze listening patterns by season/month
- Identify seasonal track preferences
- Suggest seasonal playlist variants
- Track mood changes over time

### Feature: Social Optimization
**Purpose**: Optimize playlists for group listening
**Implementation**:
- Analyze collaborative playlist patterns
- Identify tracks that work well for groups
- Social listening context optimization
- Party/workout/study mode optimizations

### Feature: Discovery Balance
**Purpose**: Balance familiar favorites with new discoveries
**Implementation**:
- Calculate familiarity scores for tracks
- Optimize discovery-to-familiar ratio
- Suggest exploration pathways
- Track discovery success rates

## üîó Technical Architecture

### Data Pipeline
```
Spotify API ‚Üí Listening History ‚Üí Skip Analysis ‚Üí Optimization Engine ‚Üí Recommendations
```

### Key Components
1. **Analytics Service**: Process listening behavior data
2. **Optimization Engine**: Generate actionable recommendations
3. **Recommendation API**: Serve optimization suggestions
4. **Frontend Integration**: Display insights and actions

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Track listening analytics
CREATE TABLE track_analytics (
    track_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    playlist_id TEXT,
    play_count INTEGER,
    skip_count INTEGER,
    completion_rate REAL,
    last_played TIMESTAMP
);

-- Optimization results
CREATE TABLE optimization_suggestions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    playlist_id TEXT,
    suggestion_type TEXT,
    track_id TEXT,
    confidence_score REAL,
    implemented BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

## üéµ User Experience Flow

### Analysis Phase
1. User analyzes playlist (existing feature)
2. System identifies optimization opportunities
3. Detailed insights provided with confidence scores

### Optimization Phase
1. User clicks "Optimize Playlist"
2. System generates specific recommendations
3. User reviews and selects desired optimizations
4. System applies changes to Spotify playlist

### Feedback Loop
